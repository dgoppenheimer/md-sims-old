# Building this site

I already have Hugo installed.

```zsh
cd Sites
hugo version
    hugo v0.89.3 darwin/amd64 BuildDate=unknown
# The latest version is v0.92.0, I'll update.
port installed
# hugo was listed, which means I installed hugo using MacPorts
# Update hugo
sudo port install hugo
```

See the [Getting Started](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/getting-started/) page of the Docsy documentation to get started.

```zsh
hugo version
    hugo v0.92.0 darwin/amd64 BuildDate=unknown
```

Success!
