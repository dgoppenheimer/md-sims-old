This section covers the use of some of the most popular docking programs including VINA (and the variants, SMINA and GNINA) as well as DOCK. Generally, these programs were run using Google Colaboratory, but we will also explore online docking servers such as [MTiOpenScreen](https://bioserv.rpbs.univ-paris-diderot.fr/services/MTiOpenScreen/).
