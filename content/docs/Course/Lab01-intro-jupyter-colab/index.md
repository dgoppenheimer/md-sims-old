## Jupyter Notebooks

[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks are documents that allow you to create, view, and run code. These notebooks are typically web-based and can contain code, text, equations, images, videos, and more. The document you are reading now is a Jupyter notebook. Importantly, these notebooks are interactive--you can change the code, run it and view the new output. Also, you can store the output of the code in the notebook and share it with others. This abilitly to document what code you executed, and the resulting output is important for recproducibility. 

Jupyter notebooks can be run locally on your own computer, and can use many different programming languages. However, we will be used a web-based notebook that uses the [python](https://www.python.org/) language.

## Google Colaboratory (Colab)

What is Google Colab? From the [Google Colab FAQ page](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html):

>Colaboratory, or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education. More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing free access to computing resources including GPUs.

Watch the video, below, to get a brief introduction to what Colab offers.
See [Get started with Google Colaboratory (Coding TensorFlow)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI) for a quick introduction to Colab.
