## Requirements

To complete the assignments for this course, you will need the following:

### Requirement 1: A Molecular Dynamics Google account

This will allow you to save your notebooks to a dedicated Google Drive that does not have any personal or UF files on it. Below are the instructions for getting your personal Molecular Dynamics Google account.

1. Go to [Google.com](https://www.google.com/) and click `Sign in`, then `Create account`.

- If you already have a Google account, Click on your profile picture, then click on `Add another account`.

- Then click `Create account` and `For myself`

2. Fill in the appropriate information for your `First name`, `Last name`, and `Password`. For the `Username`, use the following format: `<last name><first initial>.mdynamics`, but do not use spaces or the `< >` characters, and notice the `dot` before `mdynamics`. For example, my `Username` is:

```html
oppenheimerd.mdynamics@gmail.com
```

3. Follow the remaining instructions and you should be ready to go.

### Requirement 2: A Chrome web browser

Working with colab and Google drive (G-drive) works best in the [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) web browser. If you don't already have it installed, go to the [Chrome download page](https://www.google.com/chrome/) to download and install Chrome on your computer.

<mark>**Always use your mdynamics Google account to complete these assignments**.</mark>

## Workflow Summary

Here is a quick summary of how you will access course materials. Additional detailed instructions can be found below the summary.

1. Go to the [Molecular Dynamics GitHub repository](https://github.com/dgoppenheimer/Molecular-Dynamics) to see the Jupyter notebooks that contain the tutorials and assignments.
2. Choose the assignment you want to work on and click the ![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg) button. The notebook will open in your (Chrome) web browser.
3. Change accounts to your `<last name><first initial>.mdynamics@gmail.com` account.
4. Mount your G-drive.
5. Save a copy of the notebook to your G-drive.
6. Rename the notebook by prepending `<last name><first initial>-` (without the spaces or `<` `>` characters) to the notebook name. For example: `oppenheimerd-Lab01-intro-jupyter.ipynb`.
