Molecular Dynamics is a <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> site using the <a href="https://github.com/google/docsy">Docsy</a> theme. As I started designing a new course, *Practical Molecular Dynamics*, I found myself collecting an increasing amount of tutorials, code, and references, and needed a convenient way to organize them. I previously built a website using Hugo for organizing my <a href="https://dgoppenheimer.github.io/pymol-notes/">PyMOL notes</a>, and liked the way content was organized in documentation themes.
